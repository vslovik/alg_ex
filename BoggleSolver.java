/**
 * Your task. Your challenge is to write a Boggle solver
 * that finds all valid words in a given Boggle board,
 * using a given dictionary. Implement an immutable data
 * type BoggleSolver with the following API:
 * <p/>
 * Boggle boards. A boggle board consists of two integers M and N,
 * followed by the M × N characters in the board, with the integers
 * and characters separated by whitespace. You can assume the
 * integers are nonnegative and that the characters are uppercase
 * letters A through Z (with the two-letter sequence Qu represented
 * as either Q or Qu). For example, here are the files board4x4.txt
 * and board-q.txt:
 * <p/>
 * % more board4x4.txt        % more board-q.txt
 * 4 4                        4 4
 * A  T  E  E                 S  N  R  T
 * A  P  Y  O                 O  I  E  L
 * T  I  N  U                 E  Qu T  T
 * E  D  S  E                 R  S  A  T
 * <p/>
 * Performance. If you choose your data structures and algorithms
 * judiciously, your program can preprocess the dictionary and find all
 * valid words in a random Hasbro board (or even a random 10-by-10 board)
 * in a fraction of a second. To stress test the performance of your
 * implementation, create one BoggleSolver object (from a given dictionary);
 * then, repeatedly generate and solve random Hasbro boards.
 * How many random Hasbro boards can you solve per second? For full
 * credit, your program must be able to solve thousands of random Hasbro
 * boards per second. The goal on this assignment is raw speed—for example,
 * it's fine to use 10× more memory if the program is 10× faster.
 * <p/>
 * Challenge for the bored. Here are some challenges:
 * Find a maximum scoring 4-by-4 Hasbro board using the Zinga list of 584,983 Italian words.
 * <p/>
 * These are purely suggestions for how you might make progress. You do not have to follow these steps.
 * <p/>
 * Familiarize yourself with the BoggleBoard.java data type.
 * <p/>
 * Use a standard set data type to represent the dictionary, e.g., a SET<String>, a TreeSet<String>,
 * or a HashSet<String>.
 * <p/>
 * Create the data type BoggleSolver.
 * Write a method based on depth-first search to enumerate all
 * strings that can be composed by following sequences of adjacent dice. That is, enumerate all
 * simple paths in the Boggle graph (but there is no need to explicitly form the graph).
 * For now, ignore the special two-letter sequence Qu.
 * <p/>
 * Now, implement the following critical backtracking optimization: when the current path corresponds
 * to a string that is not a prefix of any word in the dictionary, there is no need to expand the path
 * further. To do this, you will need to create a data structure for the dictionary that supports
 * the prefix query operation: given a prefix, is there any word in the dictionary that starts with that prefix?
 * <p/>
 * Deal with the special two-letter sequence Qu.
 * <p/>
 * You will likely need to optimize some aspects of your program to pass all of the performance points (which are, intentionally, more challenging on this assignment).
 * Here are a few ideas:
 * <p/>
 * Make sure that you have implemented the critical backtracking optimization described above. This is, by far, the most important step—several orders of magnitude!
 * Think about whether you can implement the dictionary in a more efficient manner. Recall that the alphabet consists of only the 26 letters A through Z.
 * Exploit that fact that when you perform a prefix query operation, it is usually alomst identical to the previous prefix query, except that it is one letter longer.
 * Precompute the Boggle graph, i.e., the set of cubes adjancent to each cube. But don't necessarily use a heavyweight Graph object.
 * Consider a nonrecursive implemention of the prefix query operation.
 * Consider a nonrecursive implemention of depth-first search.
